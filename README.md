This project explores the prediction of presidential election outcomes in the United States using census data and machine learning techniques. We employ decision tree models with different criteria (Gini and Entropy) to predict the winning party (Democrats or Republicans) based on 
historical data from elections between 2008 and 2016. The trained models are then tested and compared using data from the 2020 election to evaluate their predictive performance.
